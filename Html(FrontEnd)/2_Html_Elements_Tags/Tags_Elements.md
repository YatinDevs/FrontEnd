- <!-- Block Level Elements -->
- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

- A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

- Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

- The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

- The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

- The <p> element is a block-level element.

- The <div> element is a block-level element.

- <!-- Inline Elements -->
- An inline element does not start on a new line.

- An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

- This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.


<!--Elements && Tags-->
1. Image Tag <img>

-  The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

- Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

- The <img> tag has two required attributes:

     - src - Specifies the path to the image
     - alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

- Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.

- Tip: To link an image to another document, simply nest the <img> tag inside an <a> tag (see example below).

2. iFrame tag.

-The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

- An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

- Tip: Use CSS to style the <iframe> (see example below). 

- Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the <iframe> is.
