You have to do the following things to pass all the test cases-

1. Select the div with class=”carticon”. 
Add an onclick event handler on it which adds a “cartopened” 
class to the div with class=”cartui”. This shows the cart
 items when div with class=”carticon” is clicked.

2. Now to hide the cart, select the div with class=”closecart” 
and add an onclick event handler to it. The event handler removes 
the “cartopened” class from the div with class=”cartui”.
