  What is hasOwnProperty like in JavaScript?
The hasOwnProperty() method in JavaScript is used to check whether the object has
 the specified property as its own property. This is useful for checking if the 
 object has inherited the property rather than being it's own. Parameters: This 
 method accepts a single parameter.
