- <!-- Block Level Elements -->
- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

- A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

- Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

- The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

- The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

- The <p> element is a block-level element.

- The <div> element is a block-level element.

- <!-- Inline Elements -->
- An inline element does not start on a new line.

- An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

- This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
