# Why React?

- Why should we use React?
One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential to reuse components. It saves time for developers as they don't have to write various codes for the same features. Furthermore, if any changes are made in any particular part, it will not affect other parts of the application.

- Why React is better than JS?
React provides good maintenance services for keeping the application running quickly and dynamically, compared to Javascript. Developers can easily maintain and update web applications using react reusable components and virtualDOM, making it superior to plain Javascript for ecommerce.

- Why SO :
- 1. Easy to Learn
- 2. Reusable Components (In Case : Part of Multi Page App (MPA) ).
- 3. Fast Rendering.
- 4. SEO Friendly.
- 5. Strong Community Support
- 6. Proficient Data Binding.
- 7. The Virtual DOM
- 8. Great Developer Tools.

# What is React?

- The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

- In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.  

- React’s primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application just like the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution. Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit, React.js encourages developers to separate these complex UIs into individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the whole UI. In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency of JavaScript with a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster and create highly dynamic and responsive web applications.

- In Short:
- 1. Easy Structure.
- 2. Reuseable Components.
- 3. MVC pattern.
- 4. Faster Rendering and Management.
