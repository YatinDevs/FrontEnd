# State vs. Props

- State --> Internal Data owned by Component

  - Component 'Memory'
  - Can be updated by the component itself
  - updating state causes component to re-render.
  - used to make components interactive.

- Props --> External data owned by parent component.
  - Similar to function parameters.
  - read-only
  - Receiving new props causes component to re-render.
    Usually when the parents state has been updated.
  - Used by parents to configure child Components ("settings").
